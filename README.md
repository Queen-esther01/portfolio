# Esther Ejidike — Portfolio

A minimal, modern portfolio website showcasing my work as an AI Engineer.

## Tech Stack

-   **React 19** with TypeScript
-   **Vite** for fast development and builds
-   **Tailwind CSS 4** for styling
-   **Lucide React** for icons

## Behind the Scenes

This site was built at 2am to nature/rainfall sounds on Spotify, snickers, and an occassional stare into space.

If you're here snooping through my repo — hi! Hope you like what you see. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat AI, collaborate on something cool, or yap about books.
